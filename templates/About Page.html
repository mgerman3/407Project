                <h1><strong> Around the Block</strong></h1>
                    <p>"Around the Block" is a unique apparel company co-founded
                    by Gabi McLaughlin and Joelle Anselmo, two seniors at the University of Maryland.
                    The concept for the company was sparked by our observation of
                    the distinct and recognizable house names in College Park's Old Town neighborhood.
                    We saw an opportunity to showcase the character and charm of the area through fashion and decided to bring their vision to life in October of 2022.</p>

                            <p> Instead of using new clothing items, we source our materials exclusively from local thrift stores,
                                making each piece of clothing sold truly one-of-a-kind. Our commitment to sustainability and reducing waste
                                is evident in the decision to use repurposed garments, ensuring that each item carries its own story and character.
                            </p>
                            <p>In addition to our environmentally conscious practices, we are dedicated to giving back to the community.
                                Around the Block donates 10% of our profits to Sloan Kettering Cancer Research Foundation in New York City,
                                making a positive impact in the fight against cancer.

                            <p>With each purchase from "Around the Block", customers can not only show their love for College Park,
                                but also support cancer research efforts and contribute to a noble cause.

                                    and business management. She's fascinated by human centered and big authority
                                    stories and is devoted to learning about making sustainable choices, especially in
                                    retail. When she's not writing articles in the middle of the night or conducting
                                    interview, she loves reading books, journaling, daydreaming about traveling and
                                    living abroad, running and hanging out with friends and family.

                                    During the school year, Joelle took thought-provoking, multimedia journalism
                                    classes that fine-tune her technology skills with software such as Premiere Pro, InDesign, Adobe Photoshop, and more.
                                    Her interest in journalism has encouraged her to become more involved with the surrounding community,
                                    where she has served as the President of the UMD Chapter of the Society of Professional Journal lists in her last year of college.
