    <h1>Around the Block</h1>
        <p>"Around the Block" is a unique apparel company co-founded
        by Gabi McLaughlin and Joelle Anselmo, two seniors at the University of Maryland.
        The concept for the company was sparked by our observation of
        the distinct and recognizable house names in College Park's Old Town neighborhood.
        We saw an opportunity to showcase the character and charm of the area through fashion
            and decided to bring their vision to life in October of 2022.</p>

<h1 style="text-align:right;">Our Mission</h1>
<p style="text-align:right;">Instead of using new clothing items, we source our materials exclusively
    from local thrift stores, making each piece of clothing sold truly one-of-a-kind.
    Our commitment to sustainability and reducing waste is evident in the decision to use
    repurposed garments, ensuring that each item carries its own story and character.</p>

<p> In addition to our environmentally conscious practices, we are dedicated to giving back to the community.
    Around the Block donates 10% of our profits to Sloan Kettering Cancer Research Foundation in New York City,
    making a positive impact in the fight against cancer.</p>

<p>With each purchase from "Around the Block", customers can not only show their love for College Park,
    but also support cancer research efforts and contribute to a noble cause. </p>
